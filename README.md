## About

This repository is dedicated to solving challenges publicly available on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
> "Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just
> mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a
> computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems."

*(from [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/about))*

This repository hosts several key modules, implemented in C# and C++:

- various solutions to Project Euler problems, their respective programming implementations.
- a solution testing framework for automatically parsing test problems, profiling competing solutions, and exploring a
  problem space.
- a shared mathematics library for computing combinatorics, sieving, and various other numerical computations.

In general, the solutions found here:

- are designed to pass the "one-minute rule".
- are designed to be relatively efficient and elegant.
- should have documented algorithms and explanations.
- should be generalizable to tweaked parameters.

However, in reality, what most likely is being implemented is pure chaos:
