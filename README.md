## About

This repository is dedicated to solving challenges publicly available on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
> "Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just
> mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a
> computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems."

This repository hosts several key modules, implemented in [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/):

- solutions to Project Euler problems. However, only the first 100 solutions are publicly available due to restrictions; the sources of others problems are available upon request.
- a solution testing framework for automatically parsing test problems, profiling competing solutions, and exploring a
  problem space.
- a shared mathematics library for computing combinatorics, sieving, and various other numerical computations.

In general, the solutions found here:

- are designed to pass the "one-minute rule".
- are designed to be relatively efficient and elegantly implemented.
- should have documented algorithms and explanations.
- should be generalizable to tweaked parameters.
